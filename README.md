# CS-F211-Labs
This repository contains my lab assignment submissions for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. All the submissions are in C.

Details of each week:

Week-1

Implementation of bucket sort of jobs according to priority in static memory.

Week-2

Implementation of Stack data structure with insert, delete, traverse and search functionalities.

Week-3

Implementation of MultiQ (Multi-Queues) using basic queues. Also measured running time using GNU Profiler.

Week-4

Implementation of various cycle detection algorithms in a linked list like Hare and Tort and List Reversal. Measured time complexities of individual procedures.  

Week-5

Implementation of Insertion Sort using Recursion and Iteration both. Also measured and compared their space and time complexities with simple O(n^2) curve.

Week-6

Implementation of Merge Sort using Recursion and Iteration both. A basic Makefile with targets for different steps required in testing.
